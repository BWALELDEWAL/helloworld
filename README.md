Event Management System

Overview

This system allows users to create, manage, and book event tickets. It features three main schemas:

User Schema: Manages user authentication and roles (Standard User, Organizer, Admin).

Event Schema: Stores event details, ticket availability, and organizer info.

Booking Schema: Records ticket bookings, linking users to events with statuses (Pending, Confirmed, Canceled).

The system enables event management, ticket reservations, and admin control over operations.
